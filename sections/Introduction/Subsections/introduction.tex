    A time series is a collection of measurements made sequentially through time, and they are present in a variety of fields of study \cite[Chapter~5]{chatfield2019analysis}. Stock markets, electrocardiograms, weather forecasts, seismic activities, etc, are just a few examples of time series like data that appears in different areas. With such a presence, robust methods to analyse and extract information of time series are necessary, and have been active topic in high level research for a long time. Tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification and comparison methods for time series are of vital importance to many industries and people on a daily basis.
