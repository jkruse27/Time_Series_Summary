    \subsection{Time Series in Biomedical Data}
    
        In the realm of medicine and health monitoring, time series data of biosignals holds immense value for understanding the dynamic nature of physiological processes and diagnosing various health conditions. In this section, we delve into the fascinating world of time series analysis specifically tailored to biosignals. Time series data derived from biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), electroencephalograms (EEGs), and electromyograms (EMGs), offers a unique window into the intricate interplay of physiological signals over time. By unraveling the patterns, rhythms, and anomalies embedded within these temporal sequences, we can unlock invaluable insights for disease detection, monitoring patient health, and personalized treatment strategies. With an emphasis on the unique challenges and specialized techniques associated with biosignal time series analysis, this section aims to equip researchers, clinicians, and data scientists with the tools necessary to harness the full potential of temporal data in the field of medicine. \par

        Heart rate signals, RR intervals, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and electroencephalograms (EEGs) are pivotal time series data sources in the domain of biosignals and medicine, and will be some of the emphasis of this work. Heart rate signals provide a representation of the cardiac activity over time, reflecting the rhythm and frequency of the heartbeats. Derived from heart rate signals, RR intervals capture the time intervals between consecutive R-peaks in an ECG waveform, providing valuable insights into heart rate variability and cardiac health. ECG time series data consists of voltage measurements that depict the electrical activity of the heart, offering a wealth of information about cardiac function, arrhythmias, and myocardial abnormalities. On the other hand, EEG time series data records the electrical activity of the brain, enabling the study of neural dynamics, sleep patterns, seizures, and cognitive processes. These time series data forms are indispensable in diagnosing cardiovascular disorders, monitoring cardiac health, studying brain activity, and facilitating personalized treatment approaches, making them vital tools in the field of biosignals and medicine.\par

        Time series forecasting of biosignals plays a crucial role in various applications within the field of healthcare and biosignal analysis. Here are some notable applications:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Disease Diagnosis and Monitoring: Time series forecasting enables the detection and diagnosis of various medical conditions by analyzing biosignals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), electroencephalograms (EEGs), and electromyograms (EMGs). By forecasting changes in biosignals, abnormalities and patterns associated with diseases like cardiac arrhythmias, epilepsy, and neuromuscular disorders can be detected, facilitating early intervention and monitoring of patients' health status \cite{cepulionis2016ecgforecast, fan2019, raghunath2020}. 

            \item Treatment Optimization: Time series forecasting aids in optimizing treatment strategies for patients. By analyzing biosignals over time, healthcare professionals can predict the efficacy of different treatments and adjust medication dosages, therapy interventions, or stimulation parameters in real-time \cite{nutini2022}. This helps in tailoring personalized treatment plans and achieving better patient outcomes.
        
            \item Wearable Devices and Remote Monitoring: The use of wearable devices for continuous biosignal monitoring has gained prominence. Time series forecasting techniques can analyze biosignals collected from wearables, such as heart rate variability (HRV) or sleep patterns, to provide insights into an individual's health and well-being. These forecasts enable proactive health management, early warning systems for critical events, and remote patient monitoring, leading to timely interventions and improved patient care. One very proeminent application is in female workers health assessment, as approximately half of female workers leave their jobs due to childbirth and female-specific health issues such as menopausal disorders and premenstrual syndrome \cite{schoep2019women}.
        
            \item Sports Performance and Fitness Tracking: Time series forecasting techniques applied to biosignals, such as heart rate and lactate levels, enable the prediction of performance and fatigue in athletes. This aids in optimizing training regimens, preventing injuries, and enhancing athletic performance. Additionally, in fitness tracking applications, forecasting models applied to biosignals collected from wearable devices help individuals track their progress, set achievable goals, and optimize their fitness routines \cite{stuart2022mn, ZhaoriGetu2022}.
        \end{enumerate}

        By harnessing the power of time series forecasting in biosignal analysis, healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals can make informed decisions, enhance patient care, and improve overall well-being.
