    \subsection{General Approaches}

    Firstly, methods that can be applied in general to deep learning models will be reviewed. The methods discussed in this session were mainly developed to analyse models with independent features (with images being the first example), while models more directed to time-series related architectures will be discussed in the next subsection. \par
