  abstract  = "Various approaches have been taken to detect anomalies, with
               certain particularities in the medical image scenario, linked to
               other terms: content-based image retrieval, pattern recognition,
               classification, segmentation, outlier detection, image mining,
               as well as computer-assisted diagnosis, and computeraided
               surgery. This chapter presents, a review of anomaly detection
               (AD) techniques and assessment methodologies, which have been
               applied to medical images, emphasizing their peculiarities,
               limitations and future perspectives. Moreover, a contribution to
               the field of AD in brain computed tomography images is also
               given, illustrated and assessed.",
